# Regula

**Offline-capable, code-native AI governance scanning. The core scan runs locally, does not upload scanned file contents, and needs no account; telemetry is sent only with explicit opt-in consent. Regula flags patterns that may need review under the EU AI Act, South Korea's AI Basic Act, and Colorado SB 26-189, records the deployment facts code cannot show, and reports insufficient information rather than inventing a score.**

## What it does

Regula scans a local source-code folder for patterns that may need AI governance review. A questionnaire records facts that code cannot show, such as where and how a system will be used. Results identify candidate risk categories and link to provisions that may be relevant. Regula does not determine legal classification, compliance, or the obligations that apply to a real deployment.

Reference material covers the EU AI Act, South Korea's AI Basic Act (Act No. 20676), and Colorado SB 26-189. The core install has no required third-party runtime dependencies. Optional extras add dependencies, and some optional commands or configured features can contact external services. Assess territorial scope and data-processing duties independently.

In plain English: give Regula a source-code folder and answer questions about how the system will be used. It returns possible issues and a review trail so a developer, governance lead, or adviser can decide what to investigate next. A scan with no findings does not prove that a system is compliant or low risk.

## Choose how to start

| If you want to… | Start here |
|---|---|
| Explore the questions without installing anything | Use the [browser assessment](https://getregula.com/assess/). It records declared context for review; it does not inspect your code or make a legal determination. |
| Check a local codebase | Follow the [Quick start](#quick-start), then run `regula check .`. |
| Evaluate Regula before adopting it | Follow the [10-minute example journey](examples/cv-screening-app/) and read the [documented limitations and verification evidence](docs/TRUST.md). |
| Add a repeatable team check | Use the [CI/CD example](#cicd) and review the exit-code policy before making it blocking. |
| Prepare material for a human reviewer | Generate a reviewer-completable evidence scaffold, then complete and validate its contextual fields. |

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install regula-ai      # or: pip install regula-ai / uv pip install regula-ai
```

**Not sure if the AI Act applies?** No code needed:
```bash
regula assess               # record declared context for human review
regula assess --save-facts  # and write the answers where `regula check` reads them
```

The scan tells you which facts it needs and cannot get from code. You supply
them, and the decision moves:

```bash
regula check . --list-facts                     # every fact id the model defines
regula check . --fact is_ai_system=yes \
               --fact jurisdiction_in_scope=yes # declare them for one run
```

Declared facts are **yours**, not Regula's. Each is stored with who declared it,
through which command, in answer to which question, and when, in
`.regula/facts.json`, and the scan prints that provenance beside the decision.
`unknown` is an answer and is never read as `no`. A declared fact can move a
decision from `insufficient_information` to an indication; it does not produce a
risk tier, a compliance score, a readiness percentage or an effort estimate.

**Want to scan your code?**
```bash
regula check .              # 419 tier patterns, 8 language families; runtime varies
regula check . --jurisdictions eu,korea,colorado  # all 3 jurisdictions
```

**Need a review pack?**
```bash
regula evidence-pack --project .   # reviewer-completable evidence scaffold
regula conform --sign --timestamp  # integrity metadata (requires regula[signing])
```

Generated files are inputs to human review, not an audit opinion, certification, or proof of compliance.

**Just want to see it work?** (requires the cloned repo :  `examples/` is not bundled in the pip package)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuzivaai/getregula && cd getregula
regula demo                 # scan a bundled example project
```

### Install details

The recommended install is **pipx** :  it isolates Regula from your system Python and avoids the `externally-managed-environment` error on Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora, Arch, and Homebrew Python.

If you don't have pipx yet, install it first (one-time):

| Platform | Install pipx |
|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath` |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install pipx && pipx ensurepath` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S python-pipx && pipx ensurepath` |
| Windows | `python -m pip install --user pipx && python -m pipx ensurepath` |

**Already using uv?** `uvx --from regula-ai regula` runs it with no install step (the `--from` flag is required because the PyPI package name `regula-ai` differs from the CLI name `regula`). Or install it permanently with `uv tool install regula-ai`.

**Running inside a venv or conda env?** `pip install regula-ai` works fine there :  the PEP 668 restriction only applies to system Python.

See [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md) for troubleshooting (`externally-managed-environment`, `command not found: regula` after install, PATH setup per shell).

### Try it against a known high-risk fixture:

```bash
regula check examples/cv-screening-app --scope all
```

The `--scope all` flag is needed because Regula's default scope (`production`) skips example directories. This fixture intentionally triggers an Annex III Category 4 (Employment) high-risk classification.

See [`examples/`](examples/) for runnable reference projects covering each EU AI Act risk tier, or walk through the full 10-minute evaluation journey in [`examples/cv-screening-app/`](examples/cv-screening-app/) :  install, scan, plan, gap, conform, verify, handoff to red-team tooling.

For a deeper first-time-user walk-through (policy tuning, CI integration, baselining) see [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md). The full documentation is indexed by type (tutorials / how-to / reference / explanation) in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

### CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/regula.yaml
name: AI Governance Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  regula:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kuzivaai/getregula@v1
        with:
          path: '.'
          upload-sarif: 'true'
          fail-on-prohibited: 'true'
```

## What Regula tells you

The EU AI Act defines four risk tiers. Regula maps code patterns to each:

| Tier | Action | What it means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Potentially prohibited** (Article 5) | Block indicator | Reports code patterns associated with listed practices for urgent contextual review. |
| **Potentially high-risk** (Article 6 and Annex III) | Warn + review map | Reports candidate use categories and maps provisions that may be relevant if a reviewer confirms the legal classification. |
| **Potential transparency duty** (Article 50) | Transparency indicator | Reports chatbot, synthetic-content and related implementation signals; the applicable paragraph and exceptions require review. |
| **No elevated code indicator** | Log only | Means the scanner did not observe a configured elevated indicator. It does not establish minimal-risk status or absence of legal duties. |

Every finding includes the relevant Article reference and explains when exceptions may apply. Regula flags patterns -- it does not make legal determinations.

**Multi-jurisdiction support.** Beyond the EU AI Act, Regula maps risk patterns to South Korea's AI Basic Act (Act No. 20676, in force 22 January 2026) and Colorado SB 26-189 (disclosure-focused, plus consumer correction and human-review rights, duties from 1 January 2027). Use `--jurisdictions eu,korea,colorado` on `regula check` or `--jurisdiction korea` on `regula assess` to apply the relevant framework. Each jurisdiction has its own YAML config (`references/jurisdictions/`) and tailored web questionnaire.

### REST API and web dashboard

For GRC integration or non-terminal users:

```bash
python3 scripts/api_server.py --port 8487
# Open http://localhost:8487/v1/dashboard
```

Seven endpoints: `/health`, `/v1/check`, `/v1/classify`, `/v1/gap`, `/v1/questionnaire`, `/v1/questionnaire/evaluate`, `/v1/dashboard`. All return the same JSON envelope as the CLI. No auth -- run behind a reverse proxy for remote access.

## Who is this for?

- **Solo founders and indie hackers** building AI products who need an initial list of code patterns to investigate before contextual and legal review.
- **Small teams** who want to understand their compliance exposure before it becomes a sales blocker. Enterprise procurement is already asking for AI Act evidence.
- **Engineering teams** who want EU AI Act scanning in CI/CD to catch high-risk or prohibited patterns before they ship.
- **AI governance consultants and advisors** :  run Regula on a client's codebase to produce code-observation reports, gap-review scaffolds, and hash-manifested documentation for completion and review within a broader governance engagement. Selected generated facts have repository checks; limitations and reproduction commands are recorded in the trust pack. Deliverables can carry engagement metadata (client, preparer, reference) via the `engagement:` policy section or `--client`/`--prepared-by`/`--engagement-ref` flags. See the [consultant guide](docs/consultant-guide.md) for the workflow and its boundaries.

## What Regula is (and isn't)

**Regula is:**

- A development-time compliance tool that combines static code analysis with governance questionnaires, mapping both to obligations across 3 jurisdictions (EU AI Act, South Korea AI Basic Act, Colorado SB 26-189)
- A shift-left code-indicator scanner -- like ESLint for governance review, running in your terminal or CI/CD pipeline
- A questionnaire-based assessment tool for organisational obligations that code patterns cannot verify (Articles 9, 17, 27, 72)
- Pattern-based risk indication across 3 jurisdictions, not a legal compliance certificate
- A starting point for compliance awareness, not a finish line

**Regula is not:**

- A runtime monitoring system (it analyses source code, not running systems)
- A legal compliance certificate (findings are indicators, not legal determinations)
- A replacement for enterprise GRC platforms like Credo AI or Holistic AI (it complements them)
- A production fairness testing platform (`regula bias` runs benchmark probes against a local model as a starting point, but does not replace runtime fairness monitoring)
- Legal advice (consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions)

Regula helps development teams understand their EU AI Act exposure early. It does not replace the organisational, procedural, and legal work required for full compliance. For a detailed account of what falls outside Regula's scope, see [`docs/what-regula-does-not-do.md`](docs/what-regula-does-not-do.md), and for Regula's own model card (intended use, training data, evaluation, known failure modes) see [`docs/MODEL_CARD.md`](docs/MODEL_CARD.md).

## Bias evaluation: methodology and ethics

`regula bias` runs two social-bias benchmarks against a locally-hosted
language model (Ollama, `llama3.2`/`mistral`/`qwen` variants supported)
as evidence for EU AI Act Article 10 data-governance documentation.

| Benchmark | Paper | Method | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| CrowS-Pairs | Nangia et al., 2020 | Log-probability difference between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs | Intrinsic bias in masked/causal LM output |
| BBQ | Parrish et al., 2022 | Question-answering on ambiguous-context prompts | Bias surfacing in downstream QA behaviour |

Both include Wilson confidence intervals for small-sample reliability and
bootstrap CIs for distribution estimates. Full methodology lives in
[`scripts/bias_eval.py`](scripts/bias_eval.py) and
[`docs/benchmarks/PRECISION_RECALL_2026_04.md`](docs/benchmarks/PRECISION_RECALL_2026_04.md).

**Ethics statement.** CrowS-Pairs and BBQ stereotype pairs are used
**solely for scientific evaluation** of model behaviour under controlled
conditions. Regula does **not display individual stereotype pairs** in
terminal output or reports :  only aggregated scores, confidence
intervals, and benchmark-level verdicts. The pairs are distributed under
the dataset's own licence (CC BY-SA 4.0 for CrowS-Pairs) and are not
redistributed or modified by Regula. Opinions encoded in the stereotype
pairs do not reflect the views of the maintainer, Regula contributors,
or any user running the tool; their presence is instrumental, not
endorsing. `regula bias` is a development-time starting point for bias
documentation, not a production fairness monitor :  see "What Regula is
(and isn't)" above.

## Important limitations

Regula performs **pattern-based risk indication**, not legal risk classification.

- The EU AI Act classifies risk based on intended purpose and deployment context (Article 6), not code patterns. Regula's findings are indicators that warrant human review.
- **False positives will occur.** Blind-labelled benchmark on 50 randomly selected Python AI repos measured **83.5% precision on production code** (N=115, measured on v1.7.0, labelled by a single reviewer with no inter-rater agreement measurement). Per-tier: `ai_security` (85%), `agent_autonomy` (83%), `limited_risk` (88%), `minimal_risk` (100%). The `high_risk` tier (33%, N=6) is statistically unmeasurable at this sample size. Full methodology, corpus selection, and reproduction steps: [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md).
- **TypeScript findings are advisory:** 0% precision on the current benchmark (6 FP, 0 TP). Language-specific AST gating is not yet implemented for TypeScript.
- **False negatives will occur.** Novel risk patterns not in the database will be missed.
- Article 5 prohibitions have conditions and exceptions that require human judgment.
- The audit trail is self-attesting (locally verifiable, not externally witnessed).
- This is not a substitute for legal advice or DPO review.

## Verified numbers

| What | Count |
|------|------:|
| CLI commands | 62 |
| Risk detection patterns (regexes) | 419 |
| Language families scanned | 8 (Python, JS, TS, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Jupyter) |
| Compliance frameworks mapped | 13 |
| Tests (pytest --collect-only) | 3,041 |
| Required production dependencies | 0 |

For reproduction commands, version-bounded benchmarks, known exceptions, security posture, and audit-trail design, see [`docs/TRUST.md`](docs/TRUST.md). What version numbers promise, the public API they cover, and the deprecation policy: [`docs/VERSIONING.md`](docs/VERSIONING.md).

## Privacy and data handling

Regula runs entirely on your machine. No code, findings, or metadata are transmitted to any external service. There is no account system, no API key, no telemetry by default (crash reporting requires both `regula telemetry enable` **and** an endpoint you configure yourself via `REGULA_SENTRY_DSN`; published builds ship none, and `DO_NOT_TRACK` suppresses it regardless). The tool reads your source files, analyses them locally, and writes output to your local filesystem. Network access is only used when you explicitly request it (RFC 3161 timestamps via `--timestamp`). See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full security posture.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

- Run `pytest tests/ -q` before opening a PR.
- Pattern additions go in `scripts/risk_patterns.py`. Each pattern should have a corresponding test.
- Regula is intentionally risk *indication*, not legal classification. New patterns should be conservative -- false positives erode trust more than false negatives for a developer tool.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor guide and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

### Authorship

Regula is maintained by Kuziva Muzondo. Where commits identify a co-author, that attribution records the tools or collaborators involved. The maintainer remains accountable for reviewing and accepting every merged change.

## Licence

**Engine and CLI:** [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.txt) **OR** [European Union Public Licence v. 1.2](LICENSE.EUPL) :  at your option. Pick the one that fits your context:

- **Apache 2.0** includes an explicit patent grant, making it the preferred choice for enterprise adoption, commercial redistribution, and any context where patent clarity matters.
- **EUPL-1.2** is explicitly recognised inside EU institutions and public-sector procurement, is strongly-copyleft on software, and has a formal compatibility appendix (GPL v2/v3, AGPL v3, OSL, EPL, CeCILL, MPL 2.0, LGPL, CC BY-SA 3.0) for downstream projects. If you work with a European public administration, EUPL is often the required or preferred licence.

You may choose either licence for any use. You do not need to state which one you picked, but attribution (keep the copyright notice and NOTICE file) is required under both.

**Risk patterns and regulatory data:** [Detection Rule License (DRL) 1.1](docs/LICENSE.Detection.Rules.md). You may use, modify, and redistribute the patterns freely. Attribution is required if you redistribute the patterns or use them in a product. If your tool generates match output from these patterns, the output must credit the source.
